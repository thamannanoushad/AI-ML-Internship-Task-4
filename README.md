# AI-ML-Internship-Task-4

This project builds a binary classification model using logistic regression to classify samples and evaluate its performance.

### Tasks Performed
* Loaded the dataset
* Split the dataset into test and train sets
* Scaled the features using StandardScaler
* Fit a logistic Regression model
* Trained the model
* Evaluated with confusion matrix, precision and recall, ROC-AUC score
* Tuned threshold for best f1 score
* Plotted ROC curve and confusion matrix
